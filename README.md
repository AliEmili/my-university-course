<i>We were allowed to use only html for the pages.</i>

The point for the first one was to use images, meta tags, different types of input, lists, anchor tags, scroll by clicking and so on...
<br>
Second one was a table.
<br>
Third one was a form.

First one was a table we had to design.

Second one was a card like.

Third one was a three-card landing page for service information.
